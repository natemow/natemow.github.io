## Introduction

This is a demo project illustrating full stack JavaScript development using the common `MEAN` setup.

## Server

**M**ongoDB, **N**ode.js, **E**xpress

* All API requests require a valid token issued at login through [middleware.js](https://github.com/natemow/mean_demo/blob/master/app/server/middleware.js).
* All API responses are standardized through custom [crud.js](https://github.com/natemow/mean_demo/blob/master/app/server/models/crud.js) module; all client messaging and success/failure toggling is driven by the API.

## Client

**A**ngularJS

  * Login stores the token issued from the server's `/auth` endpoint in local browser storage (via `AuthStorage`).
  * Outbound requests to the API have the `x-access-token` HTTP header added via [AuthInterceptor](https://github.com/natemow/mean_demo/blob/master/app/client/app/services/auth.js).
  * Pretty URLs, 404 handling and fading page transitions handled in [routes.js](https://github.com/natemow/mean_demo/blob/master/app/client/app/routes.js) and basic `client/assets/styles.css`.
