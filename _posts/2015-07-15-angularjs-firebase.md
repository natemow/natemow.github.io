## Introduction

This is a demo project illustrating 3-way data binding using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), inspired by Anant Narayanan's talk at NG-Conf 2014.

The Angular SPA itself was created as a proof-of-concept for a project at work (which regrettably got kiboshed). Pretty happy with the extensive use of [UI Bootstrap directives](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) in the app. The half-baked <a href="{{ page.url_demo }}" target="_blank">demo is available here</a> ...the read ops from Firebase are in pretty good shape, but the write ops still need some work. More to come.
