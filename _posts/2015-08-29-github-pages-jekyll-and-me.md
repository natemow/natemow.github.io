## Background

My buddy Max and I went to a cool user group meetup at [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) some time last year; almost all of the presenters were actively working with or on behalf of the [open data initiative](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/).

\# TODO: write more characters to form words that mean something.
