And other times life is absolutely the worst.

Rudy passed away early this morning; he had a massive seizure that pretty much 
nuked his brain and motor skills. I was able to hold him through the episode and 
eventually he stopped seizing. Then we just chatted for a while on the living 
room floor as he blinked away the rest of his being. It was all over in an hour 
or two. He was still breathing a little then but was completely unresponsive; 
his first mama came over and took us to the hospital. The prognosis there was 
not good, and I had to make the decision to let him go completely. We were with 
him through to the end.

I've had the good fortune to know Rudy for the last 8 years; he has been my 
friend and confidante through many challenging times. It's very difficult to 
communicate everything he's meant to me, to both his mamas and to his brother 
in that time - we all loved him very much, and I know many others have too over 
the years. Elijah is being a trooper, and I think he understands that both of 
our lives are very much changed now.

There's a lot of grief here, not gonna lie; I'll probably just lose it if I 
happen to see you and you ask me how I'm doing with all of this - so just don't 
for now please (though I appreciate the sentiment, truly). Instead, just 
silently toast my friend Rudy and remember him as the happy, trotting little 
gentleman that he was.

I'll miss you forever, buddy.
