## Introduction

I don't even know where to begin.

It is funny to pretend that {% include brand.html %} is a brand or software product and not a living, breathing meatbag. As such the human known as "Nate Mow" has prepared the following statements to support his brand:

* {% include brand.html %} requires 3 inputs at all times in order to value itself at all: 1) meaningful work 2) satisfaction in a job well done and 3) occassional affection and/or comraderie so that it feels pretty and remembers that there is more to life than bullets 1 and 2.

* {% include brand.html %} requires new inputs in order to grow as a unit. {% include brand.html %} is programmed to fail over to older mal inputs if left to its own devices. In order for the {% include brand.html %} unit to successfully avoid mal output, it requires upkeep and occassional, non-scheduled maintenance work. Unfortunately, the {% include brand.html %} unit does not respond well to routinely scheduled configuration checks.
