## Introduction

This is a demo project illustrating 3-way data binding using AngularJS and Firebase, inspired by Anant Narayanan's talk at NG-Conf 2014.

I created the Angular SPA itself as a demo for a project at work (which was regrettably kiboshed). A half-baked <a href="{{ page.url_demo }}" target="_blank">demo is available here</a>...the read ops from Firebase are in pretty good shape, but the write ops still need some work. More to come!
