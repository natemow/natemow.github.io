Upon execution of this Agreement, the Client agrees to pay the Consultant 

Should the Client request or approve services, equipment, costs and expenses (delivery charges, travel
expenses, software and/or hardware) that are beyond the Services described in Paragraph 1, in each
instance, the Consultant will bill the Client directly, at cost and without markup, prior to the Consultant providing
same in each instance.

unless earlier terminated by either party hereto. Either party may terminate this 
Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice.
  * **Inventions** -- Unless otherwise expressly, agreed, all right, title, and interest in the final product that is
  developed by the Consultant for the Client shall be the property of the Client. All tools, reusable
  components, and other modules (collectively known as developer toolsets) integrated in the system
  will be nonexclusively licensed to the Client, meaning that source code will be provided and may be
  modified by the Consultant. These developer toolsets will continue to be used on other projects and with
  other clients by the Consultant.

  * **No Warranties, No Guarantees** -- The Consultant shall perform hereunder in a professional manner.
  However, the Consultant's services and/or other efforts are provided without, and the Consultant expressly
  disclaims, any and all other warranties and representations, whether express or implied, or whether
  arising by statute or otherwise in law or from a course of dealing or usage of trade, including but not
  limited to any warranty of accuracy, completeness, performance, merchantability, or fitness for a
  particular purpose. The Client acknowledges that he/she/it has been provided with no guarantee
  pertaining to the result(s) achieved in or from services provided by the Consultant. The Client
  acknowledges that he/she/it must pay the Consultant in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
  regardless of the results of the Consultant's services, and that the Client's dissatisfaction with the result
  of any services or other efforts or recommendations of the Consultant does not, in and of itself, constitute
  any reasonable objection to payments due hereunder.

  * **Limitation Of Liability** -- Regardless of whether the Consultant is advised or aware of the potential for
  damages to be suffered by Client, the Consultant's liability, if any, to the Client shall not exceed the
  amount(s) paid by Client to the Consultant pursuant to this Agreement. In other words, Client's sole and
  exclusive remedy for any damage or loss in any way relating to or arising from the Consultant' acts or
  omissions shall be, at the Consultant's option, the re-performance of the relevant services or a refund of
  not more than the fees paid by the Client to the Consultant. The Consultant shall not be liable in any way to
  Client or any other person(s) or entit(ies) for consequential, exemplary, special, incidental, or punitive
  damages. This limitation applies to all claims and/or causes of action whether made individually
  and/or in the aggregate, including without limitation claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
  negligence, strict liability, misrepresentation, fraud and any and all other torts, claims, demands,
  causes of action, actions and/or lawsuits. Both Parties understand and agree that the remedies and
  limitations herein allocate the risks of product and service nonconformity between the parties in
  accordance with applicable laws and equitable principles. The fees herein reflect this allocation of risk
  and the limitation and exclusion of damages as set forth herein.

  * **Independent Consultant** -- The Consultant's services will be rendered as an independent consultant
  and not as an employee, agent, partner, or joint venturer of the Client. The Client shall not bind or
  obligate the Consultant in any way to any third party or to any work that is not expressly set forth herein.

  announcement or otherwise without the express written consent of an officer of our firm.

  judgments, causes of action, lawsuits, liability, loss, damage and/or expense, including but not limited
  to attorney's fees caused by or relating to or arising from Client's acts or omissions, Client's failure or
  refusal to perform, and/or any act(s) or omission(s) of any third part(ies).

  * **Legal Proceedings** -- If the Consultant and/or its owners, officers, directors, agents, contractors,
  employees and representatives is/are required by Client or legal process to participate, appear and/or
  testify in any judicial or administrative proceeding, Client shall pay any and all attorneys' fees, costs
  and expenses incurred by the Consultant with regard to such proceedings and preparation thereof. Said
  costs and expenses shall include but not be limited to the Consultant' fees for professional time
  expended for such proceedings and preparation thereof, and the Consultant shall have sole and
  exclusive discretion with regard to the selection of its attorney(s).

  * **Excusable Delays** -- Neither the Consultant nor the Client shall be liable or deemed to have breached
  this Agreement for (a) any delays or failure in performance or nonperformance, nor for (b) interruption
  of services, if any such delay, failure or interruption results directly or indirectly from causes beyond
  the reasonable control of either the party charged with performing. Such causes include, but are not
  limited to, adverse extreme weather conditions, strikes, riots, epidemics, war, governmental
  regulations subsequently imposed, fire, transportation or communication delays, acts of God or the
  public enemy, machine or equipment failures, earthquakes, or other natural disasters.

  service capacity in its performance hereunder.

  * **Amendments** -- No changes, modifications, or waivers to this agreement shall be binding unless
  made in writing and duly signed by authorized agents of the Parties.

  * **No Waiver** -- A failure of a Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not act as a waiver
  of that or any other provision. A waiver by a Party of any breach of this Agreement shall not act as a
  waiver of any other breach.

  * **Severability** -- If any provision of this Agreement is held in whole or in part to be unenforceable,
  invalid, void or contrary to law for any reason, that provision shall be severable and the remainder of
  this agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If any provision of this agreement is held in whole
  or in part to be unenforceable, invalid, void or contrary to law on the grounds that it unfairly or
  unlawfully favors the Consultant, the Consultant shall have the right to waive and/or not enforce any and/or
  all such provision(s). Additionally, if this agreement or any part of this agreement is held to
  unenforceable, invalid, void or contrary to law, an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction shall

  subject matter herein and may not be modified except in a writing executed by authorized agents of

  liabilities or obligations that remain to be performed or have been agreed upon as intended to apply
  following any such termination or expiration or withdrawal.

  * **Choice of Law and Interpretation** -- The law of the District of Columbia shall govern this agreement.
  If the District of Columbia's conflict of law rules would apply another state's or country's laws, the
  parties agree that District of Columbia law shall govern. Any Court or arbitrator considering this
  agreement shall not apply any presumption or make any finding by reason of the rule or conclusion
  that a document should be construed more strictly against its drafter, and the parties hereto agree
  that each participated in the preparation of this agreement upon consultation with legal counsel or the
  fair opportunity for same before execution of this agreement. Client hereby acknowledges and agrees
  that he/she/it is subject to personal jurisdiction in any court located in the District of Columbia, and
