## Introduction

Hello world. This README documents {{ site.title }}. If you happen to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer">programmer</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music">metalhead</a>, we hope you enjoy its design hilarity; if you are not those things, we hope you still find {{ site.title }} to be a useful tool despite its poor visual appeal.

## History

The {{ site.title }} README first came online in 1999; the project itself was first conceived in 1978. Both the README and project have been intermittently offline since.

The README was initially created more or less as a programming sandbox, resume and sometimes-blog for a person called Nate Mow. The README may continue to retain some of those features in current and future iterations.

Over the years, the {{ site.title }} project has slowly evolved in to we are not exactly sure what yet.

## Support

Here is some stuff that {{ site.title }} supports. {{ site.title }} wants you to support this stuff too if you are able. Because the stuff is good and good stuff is not bad.
