## Introduction

Hello, world. This README documents {% include brand.html %}. If you happen to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer">programmer</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music">metalhead</a>, we hope you enjoy its design hilarity; if you are not those things, we hope you still find {% include brand.html %} to be a useful tool despite its poor visual appeal.

## History

The {% include brand.html %} README first came online in 1999; the project itself was first conceived in 1978. Both the README and project have been intermittently offline since.

The README was initially created more or less as a programming sandbox, resume and sometimes-blog for a person called "{{ site.author }}". The README may continue to retain some of those features in current and future iterations.

Over the years, the {% include brand.html %} project has slowly evolved in to we are not exactly sure what yet.

## Support
