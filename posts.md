## Introduction

{% include brand.html %} has been doing a lot of neat open-source dev work in the last few years and has learned a lot in these travels. ({% include brand.html%} is also slightly narcissistic and craves your approval.) This section documents some of that work so that other projects and people might benefit. Sometimes {% include brand.html %} may put additional, human-readable documentation here as well.
